Could this tiny house change our future? Its designer says yes.  Why? Because it offers a more moderate solution to those who while enthused about living green, are not willing or able to sell all their worldly possessions and hit the road with a 98 square foot trailer they are towing behind their Subaru.  At just under 555 square feet, this house of the future certainly represents a paradigm shift from the McMansion.  The price? The designer hopes to be able to build the house (excluding land) for under $70,000 while using leading edge technology and 100% earth friendly materials.  While that price will not delight the do-it-yourselfer, it will very appealing to those seeking an eco-friendly home that fulfills the need to right-size and simplify.  This is a perfect choice for those who seek a house that still feels like the home they have come to know rather than feeling like an extended wilderness camping trip that never ends. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/27f4a76e-7ff3-412b-8d27-94fc5de695af.jpg)
